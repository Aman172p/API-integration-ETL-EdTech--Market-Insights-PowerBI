## Problem statement

After the launch of 5G services, the company achieved strong revenue growth in key cities. However, overall revenue has declined, accompanied by a rise in unsubscribed users. Trends in Active Users, Monthly Active Users (MAU), and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) indicate declining engagement and potential churn risks.
Management requires a dashboard to monitor Revenue, Active Users, MAU, ARPU, and Unsubscribed Users in order to identify churn drivers, assess post-5G performance, and support data-driven actions to improve customer retention and long-term business stability

## Key Findings & Insights

* **Revenue Concentration:** The top five cities remain the primary growth drivers, contributing **60% of total revenue** post-5G rollout.
* **Churn Risk in Key Hubs:** Critical revenue centers—including **Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Patna, and Raipur**—are seeing a decline in Monthly Active Users (MAU).
* **Customer Retention Warning:** An increase in inactive and unsubscribed users in these cities signals a high risk of customer churn.
* **ARPU Growth vs. Adoption:** Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) **increased by 11.05%**, indicating that while active users are paying more, high pricing may be a barrier to broader 5G adoption.
* **Strategic Need:** Urgent targeted engagement strategies are required to safeguard market share and balance revenue growth with long-term customer retention.

## Final Recommendation:

* **Targeted Re-engagement:** Launch specific marketing campaigns to stabilize and recover declining Monthly Active Users (MAU) in high-impact cities.
* **Churn Mitigation:** Proactively address the surge in unsubscribed users (UNU) to safeguard brand reputation and reduce customer attrition.
* **Pricing Optimization:** Reevaluate existing pricing structures to maintain high ARPU while ensuring costs do not drive further customer loss.
* **Dual-Growth Strategy:** Implement a balanced approach focused on retaining high-value customers while simultaneously acquiring new users in critical revenue markets.
* **Data-Driven Growth:** Adopt a proactive analytical strategy to stabilize revenue streams and ensure sustainable market share in the post-5G landscape.
